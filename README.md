# Python Mastery
A series of increasingly complex projects that incorporate key Python concepts and skills. These projects will span from beginner to advanced levels, ensuring a strong foundational understanding while pushing the limits of what you can build with Python.

## Phase 1: Fundamentals (2 Weeks)

### Project 1: Number Guessing Game
Develop a simple terminal-based game where the user guesses a random number generated by the computer. Include hints such as "higher" or "lower".

*Skills: Variables, conditionals, loops, user input.*

### Project 2: Personal Finance Tracker
Create a program that allows users to input their daily expenses and savings. Calculate the monthly total and display a breakdown of categories.

_Skills: Lists, dictionaries, functions, basic file handling._

### Project 3: To-Do List Application
Build a command-line to-do list application with features like adding tasks, marking them as complete, and viewing pending tasks.

_Skills: CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete), file handling, classes._

## Phase 2: Intermediate (4 Weeks)

### Project 4: Web Scraper
Develop a script to scrape data from a website (e.g., job postings, news headlines) and store the results in a CSV file. Implement error handling for failed requests.

_Skills: requests library, BeautifulSoup, CSV handling, exception handling._

### Project 5: Data Visualization
Load a dataset from a CSV file (e.g., weather data, sales data) and create various charts (bar, line, scatter) to visualize trends and insights using Matplotlib or Plotly.

_Skills: Pandas, Matplotlib/Plotly, data cleaning._

### Project 6: RESTful API
Build a RESTful API using Flask that performs CRUD operations on a dataset (e.g., book collection). Include endpoints for adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting records.

_Skills: Flask, HTTP methods, JSON, Postman.
_
### Project 7: Chatbot
Create a simple rule-based chatbot that responds to basic questions and stores the chat history in a text file.

_Skills: Conditionals, file handling, string manipulation, functions._

## Phase 3: Advanced (6 Weeks)

### Project 8: Machine Learning Model
Train a machine learning model on a dataset (e.g., Iris dataset for classification or Boston housing for regression) and evaluate its performance. Create visualizations to explain model predictions.

_Skills: Scikit-Learn, data preprocessing, train/test split, model evaluation, visualization._

### Project 9: Web Application
Develop a web application using Flask and integrate it with a front-end framework like Bootstrap. Allow users to interact with a database (e.g., user registration and login system).

_Skills: Flask, Jinja templating, SQLAlchemy, Bootstrap, authentication._

### Project 10: Automation Script
Automate a daily task, such as downloading files, sending emails, or interacting with APIs (e.g., fetching daily weather or stock data).

_Skills: smtplib, schedule or APScheduler, requests._

### Project 11: Multi-threaded Program
Build a multi-threaded file downloader that can handle multiple files simultaneously, displaying download progress.

_Skills: threading or concurrent.futures, file I/O, status handling._

## Phase 4: Specialization (Optional, 4 Weeks)

### Specialization Project: Data Pipeline
Build a complete data pipeline that extracts data from an API or web source, processes and transforms it, loads it into a database, and visualizes the results in a dashboard.

_Skills: ETL (Extract, Transform, Load), SQLAlchemy, Airflow, Matplotlib/Seaborn, Flask/Django._

### Specialization Project: AI-powered Application
Develop an AI-powered application, such as a sentiment analysis tool, image classifier, or recommendation system. Integrate the model into a web or desktop application.

_Skills: TensorFlow/PyTorch, Flask/Streamlit, front-end integration, model deployment._
